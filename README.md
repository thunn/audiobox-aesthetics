# audiobox-aesthetics

Unified automatic quality assessment for speech, music, and sound.

Read our paper [here](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-audiobox-aesthetics-unified-automatic-quality-assessment-for-speech-music-and-sound/).


## Installation

1. Install via pip
    ```
    pip install audiobox_aesthetics
    ```

2. Install directly from source

    This repository requires Python 3.9 and Pytorch 2.2 or greater. To install, you can clone this repo and run:
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Pre-trained Models

Model | Link
|---|---|
All axes | [checkpoint.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/audiobox-aesthetics/checkpoint.pt)

## Usage

How to run prediction:

1. Create a jsonl files with the following format
    ```
    {"path":"/path/to/a.wav"}
    {"path":"/path/to/b.wav"}
    ...
    {"path":"/path/to/z.wav"}
    ```
    or if you only want to predict aesthetic score from certain timestamp
    ```
    {"path":"/path/to/a.wav", "start_time":0, "end_time": 5}
    {"path":"/path/to/b.wav", "start_time":3, "end_time": 10}
    ```
    and save it as `input.jsonl`

2. Run following command
    ```
    audio-aes input.jsonl --ckpt "/path/to/checkpoint.pt" > output.jsonl
    ```
    If path for ckpt didn't exist or you haven't download the checkpoint, the script will try to download it automatically.

3. Output file will contains same number of rows as `input.jsonl`. Each rows contains 4 axes prediction with JSON-formatted dictionary. Check following table for more info:
    Axes name | Full name
    |---|---|
    CE | Content Enjoyment
    CU | Content Usefulness
    PC | Production Complexity
    PQ | Production Quality
    
    Output line example:
    ```
    {"CE": 5.146, "CU": 5.779, "PC": 2.148, "PQ": 7.220}
    ```



4. (Extra) If you want to extract only one axis (i.e. CE), post-process the output file with following command using `jq` utility: 
    
    ```jq '.CE' output.jsonl > output-aes_ce.txt```



## Evaluation dataset
We released our evaluation dataset consisted of 4 axes of aesthetic annotation scores. 

Here, we show an example on how to read and re-map each annotation to the actual audio file.
```
{
    "data_path": "/your_path/LibriTTS/train-clean-100/1363/139304/1363_139304_000011_000000.wav", 
    "Production_Quality": [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 9.0, 8.0, 5.0, 8.0, 8.0], 
    "Production_Complexity": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], 
    "Content_Enjoyment": [8.0, 6.0, 8.0, 5.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 6.0, 8.0, 6.0], 
    "Content_Usefulness": [8.0, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 8.0, 6.0, 10.0, 7.0]
}
```
1. Recognize the dataset name from data_path. In the example, it is LibriTTS.
2. Replace "/your_path/" into your downloaded LibriTTS directory. 
3. Each axes contains 10 scores annotated by 10 different human annotators.
